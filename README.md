# Scooch

Scooch makes slideshows easy. You bring your own content and styling. It's super lightweight, around 1.5kb gzipped and easy to customise.

## Installation

You can either download the repo, grab the JS and CSS and link them in your HTML, or if you prefer, you can install via NPM:

```bash
npm install scoochjs --save
```

## Usage

See demo in `index.html` for a setup guide.

## Options

You can pass an optional object to set any of the below items, as the second parameter, when instantiating Scooch.

e.g.

```javascript
new Scooch(element, { autoplay: false });
```

## Roadmap

-   Add lifecycle events (e.g. `init`, `onSlideChange` etc.)
-   Make fullscreen only affect slideshow element
